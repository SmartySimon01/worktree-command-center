# Install-Local (Permanent App) Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Make Worktree Command Center a normally installed Windows app with a one-command refresh (`npm run install-local`) that builds, silently reinstalls, and relaunches it — private overlay included when present.

**Architecture:** Fix the existing electron-builder config so a packaged app actually works (the PTY sidecar must be copied to `process.resourcesPath/pty-sidecar`, where `electron/main.ts` already looks), then add a small Node script that chains build → package → silent NSIS install → relaunch. No runtime code changes.

**Tech Stack:** electron-builder 25 (NSIS, already a devDependency), Node ESM scripts (`scripts/*.mjs`), PowerShell for verification.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-12-install-local-design.md`

## Global Constraints

- Windows-only feature: the script may hard-fail on non-Windows platforms.
- Per-user NSIS install: NEVER set `nsis.perMachine`. The sidecar writes `pty-sidecar/contexts/` under `process.resourcesPath` at runtime, so the install dir must stay user-writable (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs`).
- Do NOT modify `npm run dist` or `scripts/check-no-private.mjs` — the public-installer guard stays exactly as is.
- Private-including artifacts must only ever land in the gitignored `release-private/`, never in `release/`.
- Script style: tabs for indentation, single quotes, `[install-local]`-prefixed log lines (match `scripts/check-no-private.mjs` / `scripts/fix-electron.mjs`).
- The installed app resolves `node.exe`, `git`, and `claude` from PATH at runtime — document, don't bundle.

### Task 1: electron-builder packaging config

Make `npm run dist` / electron-builder produce a *working* packaged app: sidecar in resources, lean asar, output directory that doesn't collide with esbuild's `dist/`.

**Files:**
- Modify: `package.json` (the `build` block, lines 29–41)
- Modify: `.gitignore` (add `release-private/` after `release/`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `electron/main.ts` packaged-mode contract — `app.isPackaged ? path.join(process.resourcesPath, 'pty-sidecar') : …` (already in the code, unchanged).
- Produces: a `build` config that Task 2 invokes via `npx electron-builder --win --config.directories.output=release-private`. Default output for `npm run dist` becomes `release/`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Ensure this worktree has dependencies installed**

Run: `if (-not (Test-Path node_modules)) { npm install }`
Expected: no output (already installed) or a normal `npm install` finishing without errors (the `postinstall` fix-electron hook prints a `[fix-electron]` line — that's normal).

- [ ] **Step 2: Replace the `build` block in `package.json`**

Replace the current block:

```json
  "build": {
    "appId": "com.ronaldfridlyand.worktree-command-center",
    "productName": "Worktree Command Center",
    "win": {
      "icon": "assets/icon.ico",
      "target": "nsis"
    },
    "nsis": {
      "installerIcon": "assets/icon.ico",
      "uninstallerIcon": "assets/icon.ico",
      "shortcutName": "Worktree Command Center"
    }
  }
```

with:

```json
  "build": {
    "appId": "com.ronaldfridlyand.worktree-command-center",
    "productName": "Worktree Command Center",
    "directories": {
      "output": "release"
    },
    "files": [
      "dist/**",
      "index.html",
      "app.css",
      "styles.css",
      "assets/**"
    ],
    "extraResources": [
      {
        "from": "pty-sidecar",
        "to": "pty-sidecar",
        "filter": ["**/*", "!contexts/**"]
      }
    ],
    "win": {
      "icon": "assets/icon.ico",
      "target": "nsis"
    },
    "nsis": {
      "installerIcon": "assets/icon.ico",
      "uninstallerIcon": "assets/icon.ico",
      "shortcutName": "Worktree Command Center"
    }
  }
```

Why each addition:
- `directories.output: "release"` — electron-builder's default output is `dist/`, which is esbuild's output dir; without this, `npm run dist` dumps installer artifacts on top of the compiled JS. Also makes the existing README line ("`npm run dist` … `(release/)`") true.
- `files` — replaces the default "pack everything" glob; the asar carries only what `index.html` references (`dist/renderer.js`, `dist/xterm.css`, `styles.css`, `app.css`), the compiled main/preload in `dist/`, and `assets/` (main.ts reads the window icon from `__dirname/../assets`, which resolves inside the asar). `package.json` and production `node_modules` (`node-pty`, xterm) are always included automatically; electron-builder auto-unpacks native modules like `node-pty` from the asar.
- `extraResources` — copies `pty-sidecar/` onto real disk at `<install>/resources/pty-sidecar`, which is exactly `process.resourcesPath/pty-sidecar` where `electron/main.ts:12-14` looks in packaged mode. Without this, packaged terminals can never spawn. The `!contexts/**` filter keeps runtime-generated session contexts from this dev checkout (gitignored `pty-sidecar/contexts/`) out of the installer.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add `release-private/` to `.gitignore`**

Change:

```
release/
```

to:

```
release/
release-private/
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Build the app and produce an unpacked package**

Run: `npm run build; if ($?) { npx electron-builder --win --dir }`

Expected: esbuild prints `esbuild: built main, preload, renderer`; electron-builder prints `building` lines and finishes without errors (first run may take a few minutes rebuilding `node-pty` for Electron's ABI). No NSIS installer is built with `--dir` — this is the fast config check.

Note: `--dir` output goes to `release/win-unpacked` (uses the new default output). Invoking electron-builder directly (not `npm run dist`) is fine even if a `private/` overlay were present — the guard only fences the public `dist` script.

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify the unpacked package layout**

Run:

```powershell
Test-Path 'release/win-unpacked/Worktree Command Center.exe'
Test-Path 'release/win-unpacked/resources/pty-sidecar/sidecar.cjs'
Test-Path 'release/win-unpacked/resources/pty-sidecar/cos-coord.cmd'
Test-Path 'release/win-unpacked/resources/pty-sidecar/contexts'
Test-Path 'release/win-unpacked/resources/app.asar'
Get-ChildItem -Recurse 'release/win-unpacked/resources/app.asar.unpacked/node_modules/node-pty' -Filter '*.node' | Select-Object -First 1
```

Expected, in order: `True`, `True`, `True`, `False` (contexts excluded), `True`, and at least one `.node` file listed (native node-pty unpacked from the asar).

- [ ] **Step 6: Smoke-run the unpacked exe**

Run: `& 'release/win-unpacked/Worktree Command Center.exe'`
Expected: the process starts and stays up (packaged mode — sidecar resolved from `resources/pty-sidecar`). Verify with `Get-Process 'Worktree Command Center'` (listed, and still listed a few seconds later — an instant crash would be gone). Then stop it: `taskkill /IM "Worktree Command Center.exe" /F`.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```powershell
git add package.json .gitignore
git commit -m @'

### Task 2: `npm run install-local` script + docs

One command that builds (private overlay compiles in when present), packages the NSIS installer into `release-private/`, closes any running installed copy, silently installs, and relaunches.

**Files:**
- Create: `scripts/install-local.mjs`
- Modify: `package.json` (`scripts` block — add one entry after `"dist"`)
- Modify: `README.md` (build commands block + new "Install as an app" section)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the Task 1 `build` config; `npm run build` (existing); NSIS one-click silent install convention (`Setup.exe /S`); installer artifact name `<productName> Setup <version>.exe`.
- Produces: `npm run install-local` — the user-facing refresh command. No exports; exit code 0 on success.

- [ ] **Step 1: Create `scripts/install-local.mjs`**

```js
// Build the app (private overlay compiled in when present), package a Windows
// installer, silently (re)install it per-user, and relaunch the installed app.
//
// Deliberately does NOT go through `npm run dist`: that script guards against
// accidentally publishing private code in a public installer. This one targets THIS
// machine only — artifacts land in the gitignored release-private/, kept separate
// from public release/ installers.
import { execSync, spawn, spawnSync } from 'child_process';
import { existsSync, readdirSync, statSync } from 'fs';
import { join } from 'path';
import { homedir, platform } from 'os';

if (platform() !== 'win32') {
	console.error('[install-local] Windows only — this packages and installs an NSIS app.');
	process.exit(1);
}

const OUT = 'release-private';
const EXE = 'Worktree Command Center.exe';
const run = (cmd) => execSync(cmd, { stdio: 'inherit' });

console.log(existsSync('private/index.ts')
	? '[install-local] private/ overlay present — compiling it in'
	: '[install-local] no private/ overlay — building the public app');

run('npm run build');
run(`npx electron-builder --win --config.directories.output=${OUT}`);

// Newest "<productName> Setup <version>.exe" in release-private/.
const setups = readdirSync(OUT)
	.filter((f) => /Setup .*\.exe$/i.test(f))
	.map((f) => ({ f, mtime: statSync(join(OUT, f)).mtimeMs }))
	.sort((a, b) => b.mtime - a.mtime);
if (!setups.length) {
	console.error(`[install-local] no "* Setup *.exe" found in ${OUT}/ — electron-builder output changed?`);
	process.exit(1);
}
const installer = join(OUT, setups[0].f);

// Close a running installed copy so the silent installer can replace its files.
// (Non-zero exit = not running; ignore. Dev sessions run as electron.exe, unaffected.)
spawnSync('taskkill', ['/IM', EXE, '/F'], { stdio: 'ignore' });

console.log(`[install-local] installing ${installer} silently…`);
const inst = spawnSync(installer, ['/S'], { stdio: 'inherit' });
if (inst.status !== 0) {
	console.error(`[install-local] installer exited with code ${inst.status}`);
	process.exit(1);
}

// NSIS one-click installs per-user under %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\<dir derived from
// productName>; glob for the exe instead of hardcoding the directory name.
const programs = join(process.env.LOCALAPPDATA ?? join(homedir(), 'AppData', 'Local'), 'Programs');
let installed = null;
for (const d of readdirSync(programs)) {
	const p = join(programs, d, EXE);
	if (existsSync(p)) { installed = p; break; }
}
if (!installed) {
	console.log(`[install-local] installed, but ${EXE} not found under ${programs}\\* — launch it from the Start Menu manually.`);
	process.exit(0);
}
console.log(`[install-local] relaunching ${installed}`);
spawn(installed, [], { detached: true, stdio: 'ignore' }).unref();
console.log('[install-local] done — refreshed install is running');
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Add the npm script**

In `package.json` `scripts`, change:

```json
    "dist": "node scripts/check-no-private.mjs && npm run build && electron-builder --win"
```

to:

```json
    "dist": "node scripts/check-no-private.mjs && npm run build && electron-builder --win",
    "install-local": "node scripts/install-local.mjs"
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Update README**

In the "Build from source" code block, after the `npm run dist` line, add:

```
npm run install-local   # install/refresh it as a Windows app (see below)
```

After the "Build from source" section (before "### Troubleshooting"), add:

```markdown
### Install as an app

`npm run install-local` builds the app, packages a Windows installer, silently
(re)installs it per-user, and relaunches it — Start Menu entry included. Rerun it any
time to refresh the installed copy with your latest code. If a `private/` overlay is
present it is compiled in; those installers go to the gitignored `release-private/`
(separate from public `release/` artifacts) and are meant to stay on your machine.

The installed app still resolves `node.exe`, `git`, and `claude` from PATH at runtime.
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run it end-to-end**

Run: `npm run install-local`

Expected output, in order:
- `[install-local] no private/ overlay — building the public app` (this worktree has no `private/`)
- esbuild + electron-builder output ending in an NSIS installer build (this pass is slower than Task 1's `--dir` — NSIS compression)
- `[install-local] installing release-private\Worktree Command Center Setup 0.1.0.exe silently…`
- `[install-local] relaunching C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Programs\<dir>\Worktree Command Center.exe`
- `[install-local] done — refreshed install is running`

Exit code 0. The app window opens by itself.

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify the install is real**

Run:

```powershell
Get-Process 'Worktree Command Center' | Select-Object -First 1 ProcessName
Test-Path "$env:APPDATA/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Worktree Command Center.lnk"
Get-ChildItem release-private -Filter '*Setup*.exe' | Select-Object Name
git status --porcelain release-private
```

Expected: process listed; `True` (Start Menu shortcut, named per `nsis.shortcutName`); one `Worktree Command Center Setup 0.1.0.exe`; empty git status output (directory ignored).

- [ ] **Step 6: Rerun-while-running check (idempotent refresh)**

With the app still open from Step 4, run `npm run install-local` again.
Expected: same success output; the old instance closes (taskkill) and a fresh one launches. Exit code 0.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```powershell
git add scripts/install-local.mjs package.json README.md
git commit -m @'

### Task 3: Human acceptance + private-overlay install (post-merge)

The packaged mechanics are machine-verified in Tasks 1–2; what's left needs human eyes and the primary checkout (the `private/` overlay is gitignored, so it exists only there — not in this worktree).

**Files:** none (verification only).

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the installed app from Task 2; `npm run install-local` from the primary checkout after merge.
- Produces: sign-off on the spec's manual acceptance list.

- [ ] **Step 1: Human check on the installed (public/stub) app**

In the installed app launched by Task 2: window has the proper icon in taskbar + title bar; add/select a repo and spawn a Claude terminal — the terminal starts and accepts input (proves sidecar + node-pty survived packaging).

- [ ] **Step 2: Merge this branch to `main`** (via the normal finishing flow — PR or merge, user's choice).

- [ ] **Step 3: Refresh the primary checkout and install the private build**

In `C:\Users\User\Dev\worktree-command-center` (primary checkout, where `private/` lives):

```powershell
git pull
npm run install-local
```

Expected: first log line is `[install-local] private/ overlay present — compiling it in`; installer lands in `release-private/`; app relaunches.

- [ ] **Step 4: Human check on the private build**

In the freshly installed app: a private-overlay feature (e.g. the journal tile) is present — proves the overlay compiled into the installed copy.

- [ ] **Step 5: Confirm the public guard is intact**

In the primary checkout: run `npm run dist`.
Expected: it REFUSES with `dist blocked: private/ overlay present …` (exit 1). This is the spec's "unchanged behavior" acceptance item.
